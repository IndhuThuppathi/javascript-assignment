problem  1:The Persistent Counter
Yes.counterA() creates maintain independent counters.Each call to createCounter() creates a new scope .
console.log(counterA()) -> gives output as 1
console.log(counterA()) -> gives output as 2
console.log(counterB()) -> gives output as 1

Problem 2: The Delayed Greeter
Because the variable i is declared with var, all the delayed functions share the same i.
When the loop finishes, i is 3, and names[3] doesn’t exist so it’s undefined.
we can fix it by using let instead of var.
